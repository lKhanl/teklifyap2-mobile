Mobile Programming Term Project

## Getting Started

It is a project for small and medium-sized construction companies and self-employed civil engineers. Civil engineers prepare an offer about a construction and give it to a company that had the construction. The content of the offer is entirely based on construction, labor costs and materials prices. It is a summary of how much will go out of the employer's budget for a project. It is not %100 but the company gets an idea about the minimum budget and the work plan. 
 All the features of the project are designed to make it easier to make offers and archive these offers because preparing an offer means a lot of paper and excel work. Considering that an engineer will have multiple of offers, tracking them will be very difficult.
